# IMAGING-BASED-WATER-QUALITY-ASSESMENT
This project creates a non-invasive tool for estimating water contaminant concentrations, focusing on algae detection. Using image processing, it analyzes brightness and hue, calculates turbidity, and quantifies algae coverage. The system enables real-time, accessible water quality monitoring for environmental and industrial use cases.
